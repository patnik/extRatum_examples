# Built environment statistical indicators

This notebook demonstrates the use of `extRatum` package drawing on *OpenStreetMap* data.
`extRatum` provides summary statistics of local geospatial features within a given geographic area. It does so by calculating the area covered by a target geospatial feature (i.e. buildings, parks, lakes, etc.). The geospatial features can be of any geospatial data type, including point, polygon or line data.

In this example, we focus on built environment characteristics.

We make use of OpenStreetMap data and calculate point-, polygon- and line-based data features. The reference layer is the Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) boundaries for the city of Liverpool in the United Kingdom.

```{r}
library(extRatum)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(tmap)
library(osmdata)
```

## Read boundaries

First, we read in the LSOA boundaries for Liverpool. The data downloaded from CDRC website: https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/

```{r}
# 1. Read in the FUA grids
LSOAs <- st_read("layers/E08000012.shp")

```
Because the area of interest is in the UK, we select the British National Grid as a planar coordinate system of reference.

```{r}
BNG = "epsg:27700"
```


## Point data metrics

Here, we illustrate the use of `extRatum` with point data. 

We create a simple query to download point data representing shops in Liverpool.
```{r}
q <- getbb("Liverpool") %>%
  opq() %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "shop")

shops <- osmdata_sf(q)
```

And plot them.

```{r}
#tmap_mode("view") #use this code for creating an interactive map
tmap_mode("plot")

# show the points and grids
tm_shape(LSOAs) +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(shops$osm_points) +
  tm_dots()
```


Then we calculate the number of points in each polygon using the `point_calc()` function. Note that we have to pass a planar coordinate system in all our functions. Here we are using the British National Grid. 
The output of this function will be a dataframe containing:

- LSOA code;
- total area in sqm of each LSOA;
- number of points (i.e. shops) in each LSOA; and
- ratio of points to the total LSOA area (or in other words the number of points by sqm). In this way, we have a relative measure that can be compared across all LSOAs and is independent of their geographical area.

Note that we have used the argument `total_points = TRUE` which returns the total number of points without differentiating between different shop types.

```{r}

Shops_total <- point_calc(
  point_data = shops$osm_points,
  higher_geo_lay = LSOAs,
  unique_id_code = 'lsoa11cd',
  crs = BNG,
  total_points = TRUE
  )

# inspect the results
head(Shops_total)


```

In some cases, we want to know the split between different types of points. To that end, we can change the `total_points = FALSE` and specify the column name that includes the classification (see `class_col`).

```{r}

Shops_class <- point_calc(
  point_data = shops$osm_points,
  higher_geo_lay = LSOAs,
  unique_id_code = 'lsoa11cd',
  class_col = 'shop',
  crs = BNG,
  total_points = FALSE
  )



```

The output of this function will be a list of three dataframes.

1. A dataframe in long format reporting: 

- LSOA codes;
- total area in sqm of each LSOA;
- classification of the points within each LSOA;
- number of points in each class (i.e. bakery, beauty) in each LSOA; and
- ratio of points in each class to the total LSOA area (or in other words the number of points by sqm).


```{r}
head(Shops_class$PointsLong)

```

2. A dataframe in wide format reporting: 

- LSOA codes;
- number of points in each class (i.e. bakery, beauty) in each LSOA.

```{r}
head(Shops_class$PointsCountWide)

```

3. A dataframe in wide format reporting: 

- LSOA codes;
- ratio of points in each class to the total LSOA area (or in other words the number of points by sqm).

```{r}
head(Shops_class$PointsRatioWide)

```

Finally we can map the results to show the density of shops in the city of Liverpool at the LSOA level. 
```{r}
# attach the information calculate using extRatum to the LSOA boundaries
Liv_shops_geo <- dplyr::left_join(LSOAs, Shops_total, by = "lsoa11cd")

tm_shape(Liv_shops_geo) +
  tm_fill("NoPoints", style = "fisher", palette = "Reds", alpha = 0.6)
```


## Polygon data analysis
Next, we illustrate the use of `extRatum` with polygon data.

We create a query to download building footprints for the city of Liverpool using *OpenStreetMap* data.
```{r}
q2 <- getbb("Liverpool", limit = 100) %>%
  opq() %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "building")

buildings <- osmdata_sf(q2)

```

We can then subset the buildings that are classified as retail. 

```{r}
retail_buildings <- subset(buildings$osm_polygons, building=="retail")

```


Then, we run the function that calculates the area in sqm covered by retail buildings in each LSOA using `areal_calc()` function.

```{r}
Liv_retail <- areal_calc(
  polygon_layer = retail_buildings,
  higher_geo_lay = LSOAs,
  unique_id_code = 'lsoa11cd',
  crs = BNG
  )

```

The output of this function will be a dataframe containing:

- LSOA codes;
- total area in sqm of each LSOA;
- area in sqm covered by the geospatial feature we have selected in each LSOA; and
- ratio of geospatial feature area to the total LSOA area (or in other words the area covered by the geospatial feature by sqm).

Given that everything is measured in sqm, the ratio represents what is the % of area covered by retail buildings by sqm. In this way, we have a relative measure that can be compared across all LSOAs and is independent of their size.

We can also transform the calculated values in sqkm by dividing the value in sqm by 1,000,000. This can be done as follows.

```{r}
Liv_retail$AreaCovered_sqkm <- Liv_retail$AreaCovered /1000000

head(Liv_retail)
```

Finally, we can plot the results, showing the total area covered by retail buildings in each LSOA in Liverpool.
Note that OSM data on retail buildings are not complete for the city of Liverpool. Thus, we see too many LSOAs with missing data. 

```{r}
Liv_retail_geo <- dplyr::left_join(LSOAs, Liv_retail, by = "lsoa11cd")

tm_shape(Liv_retail_geo) +
  tm_fill("AreaCovered", style = "fisher", palette = "Reds", alpha = 0.6) 
```


## Line data analysis

Now, we illustrate the use of `extRatum` with line data.

We create a query to download highway lines for the city of Liverpool using OpenStreetMap data.

```{r}
q3 <- getbb("Liverpool") %>%
  opq() %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "highway")

highways <- osmdata_sf(q3)
```

We can then create subsets of the dataset such as pathways for pedestrian use.

```{r}
pedestrian <- subset(highways$osm_lines, highway == "pedestrian")
```

Then we can calculate the total length of pedestrian pathways routes by LSOA using `line_calc()` function.

```{r}
Liv_footways <- line_calc(
  line_layer = pedestrian,
  higher_geo_lay = LSOAs,
  unique_id_code = 'lsoa11cd',
  crs = BNG
  )


```

The output of this function will be a dataframe containing:

- LSOA codes;
- total area in sqm of each LSOA;
- total line length in metres by the geospatial feature we have selected in each LSOA; and
- ratio of geospatial feature length to the total LSOA area (or in other words the length of the geospatial feature by sqm). In this way, we have a relative measure that can be compared across all LSOAs and is independent of their size.

```{r}
head(Liv_footways)
```


Finally, we can plot the results, showing the total length of pedestrian pathways in each LSOA in Liverpool.
Note that the majority is around Liverpool city centre where we see darker colours. 

```{r}
Liv_footways_geo <- left_join(LSOAs, Liv_footways, by = "lsoa11cd")


tm_shape(Liv_footways_geo) +
  tm_fill("TotalLength", style = "fisher", palette = "Reds", alpha = 0.6)
```
